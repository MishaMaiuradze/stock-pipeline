lets create project:
which uses BINANCE finance api for stock prices, 

it should be straming and use 
*apache kafka (lastest version without zookeper)
*flink
*spark 

final result to POSTGRE SQL 
on postgre simple apache superset dashboard for monitoring prcies.

everthing should be in containers and now other enviroments, even python
after restarting containres data should not be lost.
